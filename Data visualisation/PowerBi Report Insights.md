# 🏍 TwoWheels — Sales Analysis & Business Intelligence

A real-world analytical breakdown designed to guide growth decisions, not just visualize numbers.

# 📥 Why This Report Was Created

Modern businesses don’t struggle due to lack of data — they struggle because data often exists without meaning.

This Power BI report was built to answer one question:

"How can TwoWheels increase revenue by understanding who buys, what sells, and where to scale?"

This document explains the insights in a practical, market-driven way — the way a business leader or recruiter expects.

# 🔍 What We Discovered 
## 1. Revenue Dependency on a Few Markets

The United States generates the highest sales — almost twice as much as others.
This is good for stability but risky for scalability.

Real-world implication:
→ If U.S. sales fall, the business feels the shock immediately.
→ We need new contribution from Germany, France, Canada & AU for balance.

Opportunity:
Expand supply chain + region-focused marketing → reduce risk, increase reach.

## 2. The 41–60 Age Group is the Gold Mine

This segment buys more than any other.

Why this matters:

They likely have higher disposable income

They show interest in premium products

They are consistent, loyal purchasers

Business move:
→ Launch premium touring bikes, exclusive loyalty plan, luxury add-ons.
Instead of chasing new customers blindly, double down on those who already trust the brand.

## 3. Bikes Sell — But Accessories Aren’t Getting Attention

Bikes dominate revenue; Accessories & Clothing barely contribute.

This is unrealized money.

If even 10–15% of bike buyers add accessories/clothing to their cart → revenue skyrockets without acquiring new customers.

Solution ideas:

Strategy	Expected Impact
Bundle bikes + helmets/gloves	Higher average order value
Accessory discounts on repeat orders	Long-term retention
Season-based clothing launches	Fresh recurring revenue

Revenue growth is already available inside the customer base.

## 4. Gender Gap Means Untapped Market

Sales lean heavily male.
Female biker community is growing globally — ignoring it means leaving revenue on the table.

Growth ideas:

Introduce women-specific riding gear

Feature women bikers in marketing campaigns

Host female-only riding events

Not only revenue — brand perception evolves too.

## 5. Yearly Growth Exists, But It's Not Exponential Yet

Sales trend is healthy but the year-end dip can’t be ignored.

A dip is a story.
Every story has a reason:
Seasonality? Inventory? Market shift? Marketing pause?

Solving it could unlock an entire growth surge.

Action:
Investigate Q4 patterns → adjust pricing, campaigns, delivery cycles accordingly.
